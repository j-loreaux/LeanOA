\section{WStarAlgebras and their Topologies}

In this section we define the topologies and need to prove that $W^{*}$--algebras are closed with respect to these. Must also put these
dependencies explicitly into the results that use them below. 

Maybe collect things into Basic CStar section and Basic WStar section?

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:sigma_closed_star_subalg_wstar} (Sakai 1.1.4)
  A self-adjoint, $\sigma$--closed $*$--subalgebra $N$ of a $W^{*}$--algebra $M$ is also a $W^{*}$--algebra, since $(M_{*}/N^{0})^{*}=N$, where
  $N^{0}$ is the polar (annihilator) of $N$ in $M_{*}$, i.e. the set of $\varphi\in M_{*}$ such that $\varphi(x)=0$ for all $x\in N$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:cut_down_sigma_closed_cts} (Sakai 1.7.6)
  Let $p$ be any projection in $M$. Then the subalgebra $pMp$ is $\sigma$--closed and the mapping $x\mapsto pxp$ is $\sigma$--continuous.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:cut_down_of_wstar} 
  \uses{lem:cut_down_sigma_closed_cts,lem:sigma_closed_star_subalg_wstar}
  If $p\in M$ is a projection, $pMp$ is also a $W^{*}$algebra with identity $p$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  It is clear that $eMe$ is an algebra, since any sum or product of elements preserves the pre and post multiplication by $e$.
  It is also clear that $e$ is the multiplicative identity of this algebra. The product reversing property of $*$ and the fact that
  $e$ is a self-adjoint projection implies that $eMe$ is a $*$--algebra. By Lemma \ref{lem:sigma_closed_star_subalg_wstar}, if this 
  $*$--subalgebra is $\sigma$--closed, then it is a $W^{*}$--subalgebra of $M$. But this is the result of \ref{lem:cut_down_sigma_closed_cts}.
\end{proof}
