\section{WStarAlgebras and their Topologies}

In this section we define the topologies and need to prove that $W^{*}$--algebras are closed with respect to these. Must also put these
dependencies explicitly into the results that use them below. 

\section{Normality and Ultraweak Continuity for Positive Functionals}

In what follows, let $M$ be a (nonzero) $W^{*}$--algebra. Let $\mathcal{P}(M)$
denote the projection lattice of $M$. Let $\varphi$ be a positive linear functional $\varphi$ on $M$.
We say $\varphi$ is \textbf{normal} if whenever $(p_{\alpha})$ is an increasing net of projections in $M$ with supremum $p$,
we have $\varphi(p_{\alpha})\to \varphi(p)$. In this section we show that this property is equivalent to 
$\sigma(M, M_{*})$--continuity. We say that a linear functional $\varphi$ on $M$
is \textbf{positive} if $\varphi(x)\ge 0$ whenever $x\ge 0$.

\textit{To do : Net results must be replaced by filter results.}

\subsection{Ultraweakly Continuous Implies Normal} 

This is 1.7.4 in Sakai. Roughly, taking an increasing net of projections, it converges to the supremum strongly, hence $\sigma$-topology,
and the $\sigma$-continuity finishes the proof.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{lem: sigma_cont_of_normal (Sak 1.7.4)}
  Every uniforly bounded, increasing directed set converges
  to its least upper bound in the $\sigma$--topology. Further, if
  $x=\sup_{\alpha}x_\alpha$ then $a^{*}xa=\sup_{\alpha}a^{*}xa$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Normal Implies Ultraweakly Continuous}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: selfadjoint_le_norm}
  For all self-adjoint $x\in M$, $\|x\|1-x \ge 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: proj_sub_of_subproj}
  For all $p,q\in \mathcal{P}(M)$ such that $q\le p$, $p-q\in \mathcal{P}(M)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: proj_of_sup_proj}
  For every increasing bounded net $(p_{\alpha})$ of projections in $M$, the supremum $p$
  is a projection in $M$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

If $P:\mathcal{P}(M)\to \text{Prop}$ is a predicate, the usual ordering ``$\le$'' on projections
induces an order on the set $\{p\in \mathcal{P}(M)|P(p)\}$. In what follows there will be no confusion if 
we also denote this induced order by ``$\le$''.

The following lemma undoubtedly exists in Mathlib in more generality already.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: uw_pos_sep_pts}
For every nonzero element $a\in M$, there is a $\sigma(M,M_{*})$--continuous positive linear
functional $\psi$ on $M$ such that $\psi(a)\ne 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: exists_uw_ge_normal}
  For every positive normal linear functional $\varphi$ and nonzero $p\in \mathcal{P}(M)$
  there exists a positive $\sigma(M,M_{*})$--continuous linear functional $\psi$ such that $\varphi(p)<\psi(p)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: msr_th_lemma}
  \uses{lem: sigma_cont_of_normal (Sak 1.7.4),lem: proj_of_sup_proj,lem: proj_sub_of_subproj}
For all positive linear functionals $\varphi,\psi$ with
$\varphi$ normal and $\psi$ $\sigma(M,M_{*})$--continuous and every nonzero $p\in \mathcal{P}(M)$
such that $\varphi(p)<\psi(p)$, there exists a nonzero $p_1 \in \mathcal{P}(M)$ such that $p_1\le p$ and for all nonzero
$q\in \mathcal{P}(M)$ with $q\le p_1$, we have $\varphi(q)<\psi(q)$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We proceed by contradiction. Suppose the conclusion does not hold. Then, for every nonzero subprojection
  $p_1$ of $p$ there is a nonzero subprojection $q\le p_1$ such that $\varphi(q)\ge \psi(q)$. In particular,
  (letting $p_1=q$) there is a $q\le p$ such that $\varphi(q)\ge \psi(q)$. If $(q_\alpha)$ is a chain
  of such nonzero projections, $q_{\alpha}\to \sup q_{\alpha}$ in the $\sigma$--topology by Theorem \ref{lem: sigma_cont_of_normal (Sak 1.7.4)}, 
  and by Lemma \ref{lem: proj_of_sup_proj} we know this supremum is a subprojection of $p_1$. Since $\varphi$
  is positive and normal, and $\psi$ is positive and $\sigma$--continuous, we have $\varphi(\sup q_{\alpha})\ge \psi(\sup q_{\alpha})$.
  Therefore, by Zorn's Lemma, there is a maximal $q_{0}\le p$ such that $\varphi(q_0)\ge \psi(q_0)$. We claim $q_{0}=p$. If not, 
  $p-q_0$ is a nonzero subprojection of $p$ by Lemma \ref{lem: proj_sub_of_subproj}, and there exists a nonzero projection $q_{1}\le p-q_{0}$
  such that $\varphi(q_{1})\ge \psi(q_{1})$. But then $q_{0}$ is a proper subprojection of $q_0+q_1$ and by linearity and positivity 
  $\varphi(q_0+q_1)\ge \psi(q_0+q_1)$ contradicting the maximality of $q_0$. Thus $p=q_0$ and so $\varphi(p) \ge \psi(p)$, contradicting 
  the hypothesis $\varphi(p)<\psi(p)$.  
\end{proof}

Recall that a compact Hausdorff space is \textbf{Stonean} if the closure of every open set is open.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: fin_lin_approx_of_stonean (Sak  1.3.1)}
  Let $K$ be a Stonean space. Then every element $a$ in $C(K)$ can be uniformly approximated by 
  finite linear combinations of projections in $C(K)$. If $a\ge 0$ then the coefficients of the approximating 
  linear combinations may be chosen nonnegative.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: cut_down_of_wstar} 
  If $p\in M$ is a projection, $pMp$ is also a $W^{*}$ algebra with identity $p$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: spec_masa_wstar_stonean (Sak 1.7.5)}
  If $C$ is any maximal commutative $C^*$--subalgebra of the $W^{*}$--algebra $M$, its
  spectrum space (maximal ideal space) is Stonean.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

Note that the following likely contains the most crucial use of the normality of $\varphi$ for the later proof 
of Theorem \ref{thm: sigma_cts_of_normal}.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: zorn_base}
  \uses{lem: proj_sub_of_subproj, lem: selfadjoint_le_norm}
  Let $\varphi$ be a normal positive linear functional on $M$ and consider the predicate $P:\mathcal{P}(M)\to \text{Prop}$ defined, for $p\in \mathcal{P}(M)$, by 
  ``$M\ni x \mapsto \varphi(xp)$ is $\sigma(M,M_{*})$--continuous''. If $(p_{\alpha})$ is a chain of projections in $M$ such that $P(p_{\alpha})$ is true for each $\alpha$,
  then $P(\sup(p_{\alpha}))$ is true. Hence by Zorn's Lemma there is a maximal $p_0\in \mathcal{P}(M)$ such that $P(p_0)$ is true.  
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $x$ be on the unit sphere. By Lemma \ref{lem: proj_sub_of_subproj} we know $p-p_\alpha$ is a projection. By the $C^{*}$--property
  of the norm ($\|x^{*}x\|=\|x\|^{2}$), Lemma \ref{lem: selfadjoint_le_norm} and the positivity of $\varphi$ we have $\varphi(x^{*}x)\le \varphi(1)$.
  Now these facts together with Cauchy-Schwartz and the monotonicity of square roots, 
  \begin{align}
    |\varphi(x(p-p_{\alpha}))|&\le \varphi(x^{*}x)^{1/2}\varphi(p-p_{\alpha})^{1/2}\\ \nonumber
    &\le \varphi(1)^{1/2}\varphi(p-p_{\alpha})^{1/2}.
  \end{align}
  Hence, by the definition of operator norm, $\|\varphi(\cdot(p-p_{\alpha}))\|\le \varphi(1)^{1/2}\varphi(p-p_{\alpha})^{1/2}$. The right
  hand side converges to 0 with $\alpha$ due to the normality of $\varphi$ and therefore $\varphi(\cdot p_{\alpha})$ converges to $\varphi(\cdot p)$
  in norm. Since the set of $\sigma$--continuous functionals on $M$ is norm closed, it follows that $\sigma(\cdot p)$ is $\sigma$--continuous.
  We obtain a maximal $p_{0}$ by Zorn's Lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: bdd_sigma_cts_iff_bdd_s_cts (Sak 1.8.10)}
  A linear functional $\rho$ on $M$ is $\sigma$ continuous on the unit sphere (hence $\sigma$--continuous) if and only if it is $s$--continuous on the
  unit sphere (hence $s$--continuous).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: wstar_of_masa}
  A maximal abelian $*$--subalgebra of a $W^{*}$--algebra $M$ is also a $W^{*}$--algebra.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm: sigma_cts_of_normal}
  \uses{lem: zorn_base, lem: exists_uw_ge_normal, lem: msr_th_lemma, lem: cut_down_of_wstar, lem: spec_masa_wstar_stonean, lem: fin_lin_approx_of_stonean, lem: bdd_sigma_cts_iff_bdd_s_cts, lem: wstar_of_masa}
  Every positive normal linear functional $\varphi$ on $M$ is $\sigma(M,M_{*})$--continuous.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  The claim is obvious for the zero functional. Let $\varphi$ be a nonzero positive normal linear functional. By Lemma \ref{lem: zorn_base} we have
  a maximal $p_0\in \mathcal{P}(M)$ such that $M\ni x \mapsto \varphi(xp_0)$ is $\sigma(M,M_{*})$--continuous. Assume for the purposes of finding
  a contradiction that $p_0\ne 1$. By Lemma \ref{lem: exists_uw_ge_normal}
  there is a $\sigma(M,M_{*})$--continuous positive functional $\psi$ on $M$ such that $\varphi(1-p_0)<\psi(1-p_0)$. By Lemma \ref{lem: msr_th_lemma}
  there is a nonzero subprojection $p\le 1-p_0$ in $M$ such that $\varphi(q)< \psi(q)$ for every nonzero $q\le p$ in $M$. Let $x\in pMp$ be on the unit sphere. 
  Then $x^{*}x$ is positive and hence normal, so the $C^{*}$--subalgebra of $pMp$ generated by $x^{*}x$ and $p$ is commutative, and is hence contained in a maximal abelian
  $*$--subalgebra $A$ of $pMp$. Now $A$ is a $W^{*}$--subalgebra of $pMp$ by Lemma \ref{lem: wstar_of_masa} and hence is a maximal commutative $C^{*}$--subalgebra of $pMp$. Via the Gelfand Transform, 
  $A$ is star isomorphic to $C(K)$, where $K$ is Stonean by Lemmas \ref{lem: cut_down_of_wstar} and \ref{lem: spec_masa_wstar_stonean (Sak 1.7.5)}. 
  By Lemma \ref{lem: fin_lin_approx_of_stonean (Sak  1.3.1)} it follows that $\varphi(a)\le \psi(a)$ for every $a\ge 0$ in $A$, which holds a fortiori for $a\ge 0$ in $C^{*}(x^{*}x,p)$. 
  In particular, $\varphi(px^{*}xp)\le \psi(px^{*}xp)$. Therefore,
  \begin{align}
    |\varphi(x(p_0+p))|&\le |\varphi(xp_0)|+|\varphi(xp)|\\ \nonumber
    &\le |\varphi(xp_0)|+\varphi(1)^{1/2}\varphi(px^{*}xp)^{1/2}\\ \nonumber
    &\le |\varphi(xp_0)|+\varphi(1)^{1/2}\psi(px^{*}xp)^{1/2}.
  \end{align}
  Since $x\mapsto \varphi(xp_0)$ is $\sigma$--continuous, it is $s$-continuous by Lemma \ref{lem: bdd_sigma_cts_iff_bdd_s_cts (Sak 1.8.10)}. The seminorm
  $x \mapsto \psi(px^{*}xp)^{1/2}$ is a defining seminorm for the $s$--topology on $M$. It follows that $x\mapsto \varphi(x(p_0+p))$ is $s$-continuous
  and therefore $\sigma$--continuous. This contradicts the maximality of $p_0$, and therefore $p_0=1$ and the result follows. 
\end{proof}
