# Extending an `ℝ`-linear functional to a `𝕜`-linear functional

In this file we provide a way to extend a (optionally, continuous) `ℝ`-linear map to a (continuous)
`𝕜`-linear map in a way that bounds the norm by the norm of the original map, when `𝕜` is either
`ℝ` (the extension is trivial) or `ℂ`. We formulate the extension uniformly, by assuming `RCLike 𝕜`.

We motivate the form of the extension as follows. Note that `fc : F →ₗ[𝕜] 𝕜` is determined fully by
`re fc`: for all `x : F`, `fc (I • x) = I * fc x`, so `im (fc x) = -re (fc (I • x))`. Therefore,
given an `fr : F →ₗ[ℝ] ℝ`, we define `fc x = fr x - fr (I • x) * I`.

In `Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Module/RCLike/Extend.lean` we show that this extension is isometric.
This is separate to avoid importing material about the operator norm into files about more
elementary properties, like locally convex spaces.
